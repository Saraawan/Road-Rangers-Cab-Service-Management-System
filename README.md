# Road-Rangers-Cab-Service-Management-System
## Project Overview
Road Rangers aims to revolutionize cab service operations by introducing an efficient software application. This system will manage passenger ride requests, facilitate driving opportunities for captains, and enhance the overall experience for both passengers and captains. It includes various ride options, transparent fare calculations based on distance and ride type, and tracking of essential metrics for improved service delivery and operational efficiency.

## Project Purpose, Scope, and Objectives
Purpose: To develop a robust software application optimizing the ride request process for passengers and captains, enhancing customer satisfaction, streamlining ride selection, and fare calculation while providing an intuitive platform for captains to efficiently accept and fulfill ride requests.

## Objectives:

Develop a user-friendly interface for passengers to request rides conveniently.
Create an intuitive platform for captains to accept and fulfill ride requests efficiently.
Implement a transparent fare calculation system based on distance and ride type.
Track and record ride details for analysis and performance monitoring.
## Project Description
## The cab service system comprises several modules:

1. Passenger Module: Allows passengers to register, log in, request rides, choose ride options, view estimated fares, and track ride progress.
2. Captain Module: Enables captains to register, log in, view, accept or reject ride requests, view ride details, and update ride statuses upon completion.
3. Fare Calculation Module: Dedicated to accurately calculating fares based on distance traveled and ride type, ensuring transparency and fairness in pricing.
4. Ride Tracking and Reporting Module: Tracks ride details, including distance, time, and fares, and generates reports on the number of rides taken, total profits, and other metrics.
## Course Concepts to Be Used
1. Utilizing PL/SQL programming.
2. Applying normalization.
3. Implementing SQL commands for database operations.
## Team Profile
Every team member will contribute equally to the project.

## Assumptions and Constraints
1. Assumptions:

Availability of a stable network connection for real-time ride requests and updates.
Accurate mapping and GPS systems to calculate distances for fare computation.
Proper adherence to regulatory requirements and legal standards.
2. Constraints:

Potential technological limitations or compatibility issues during system development.
